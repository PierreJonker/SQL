-- Assumes script 3-4 has been run

SELECT
    timestamp_column,
    interval_column,
    timestamp_column - interval_column AS new_date

-- Listing 3-6: Three CAST() examples

SELECT timestamp_column, CAST(timestamp_column AS varchar(10))
FROM date_time_types;

SELECT numeric_column,
       CAST(numeric_column AS integer),
       CAST(numeric_column AS varchar(6))

SELECT numeric_column,
       CAST(numeric_column AS integer),
       CAST(numeric_column AS varchar(6))
FROM number_data_types;

-- Does not work:
SELECT CAST(char_column AS integer) FROM char_data_types;

-- Alternate notation for CAST is the double-colon:
SELECT timestamp_column::varchar(10)
FROM date_time_types;





1. Appropriate Data Type for Mileage Column
Question:Your company delivers fruit and vegetables to local grocery stores, and you need to tra*ck the mileage driven by each driver each day to a tenth of a mile. Assuming no driver would ever travel more than 999 miles in a day, what would be an appropriate data type for the mileage column in your table? Why?

Answer: The appropriate data type for the mileage column would be NUMERIC(5,1).

2. Appropriate Data Types for Drivers’ Names
Question: In the table listing each driver in your company, what are appropriate data types for the drivers’ first and last names? Why is it a good idea to separate first and last names into two columns rather than having one larger name column?

Answer: The appropriate data type for both the first and last names would be VARCHAR.

3. Converting Malformed Date String to Timestamp
Question: Assume you have a text column that includes strings formatted as dates. One of the strings is written as '4//2017'. What will happen when you try to convert that string to the timestamp data type?

Answer: When you try to convert the string '4//2017' to the timestamp data type, you will encounter an error.
